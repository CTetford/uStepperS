- moved the absolute position counter into the encoder getangle function
- added a LP filter on the absolute position data in the encoder function (so, getAngleMoved is filtered)
- stall detection removed from timer1
- samplerate on timer1 doubled to 2kHz
- Variable filter depending on mode set in setup routine
- removed obsolete things in setuproutine and timer1
- made new velocity measurement for encoder values
- made the control threshold for closed loop control variable and intrduced a function for editing it
- TODO: remove stall function & edit functions using stalldetection
