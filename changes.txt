- moved the absolute position counter into the encoder getangle function
- added a LP filter on the absolute position data in the encoder function (so, getAngleMoved is filtered)
- stall detection removed from timer1
- samplerate on timer1 doubled to 2kHz
- TODO: remove stall function & edit functions using stalldetection
